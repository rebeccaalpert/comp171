<p>As <a href="">Mr. Sanders</a> holds rallies with thousands of supporters, Mrs. Clinton spoke to a small congregation on Tuesday, not 

far from where Dontre D. Hamilton was fatally shot by a white <a href="">police officer</a> in 2014. She paraphrased Galatians 6:9, 

telling churchgoers, some of whom cried and wailed thinking of <a href="">lost loved ones</a>, "Let us not grow weary of doing good 

because in due time we will harvest, if we stay focused."</p>
