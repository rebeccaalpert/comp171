# comp171

Prototype for new mobile ice cream ordering system. Built with Bootstrap 3 for usability testing purposes; no real functionality (databases, etc.) will be implemented.

Version one was based on a paper prototype. Version two is a slightly improved version based on feedback from our usability test subjects.

Hoping to add some fun with local storage later on so the system actually reflects user choices (rather than constained, hard-coded dummy ones).

Time spent: 5.5 hours
