# comp171

Prototype for new mobile ice cream ordering system. Built with Bootstrap 3 for usability testing purposes; no real functionality (databases, etc.) will be implemented.

Hoping to add some fun with local storage so the system actually reflects user choices (rather than constained, hard-coded dummy ones).

Time spent: 2.5 hours
